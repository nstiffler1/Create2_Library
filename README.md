# Create2_Library
Dr. Stiffler's Python3 code for the iRobot Create 2.

This code is a fork of two projects:

1. The first is the [pycreate2](https://github.com/MomsFriendlyRobotCompany/pycreate2) package from Major Kevin Walchko at the US Air Force Academy 
2. The second is the [Create2_TetheredDrive.py](https://www.irobot.com/~/media/MainSite/PDFs/About/STEM/Create/Python_Tethered_Driving.pdf) file that was initially provided by iRobot . 
	
	a. A python3 version was later supplied by (https://edu.irobot.com/learning-library/python-tethered-driving-for-create-2) the code can be found at: https://github.com/iRobotSTEM/CreatePython
	b. This project uses a fork of the Python3 variant from Dr. Stiffler's repository which can be found at: https://github.com/DrR0b0tN1ck/Create2_TetheredDrive

## Note on Copyright
To my knowledge, I have done my best to:

- Retain the MIT copyright from Major Walchko's project for the code that appears in the "createlib" directory. 
- The copyright notice from the iRobot Corporation that appears at the top of the "Create2_TetheredDrive.py" file, now appears in the "Create2_proj.py" file.
